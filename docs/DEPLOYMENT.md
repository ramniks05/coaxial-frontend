# Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Learning Management System frontend to Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Railway](https://railway.app) account
2. Your backend API deployed and accessible (or use Railway for backend too)
3. Git repository pushed to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Application

The application is already configured for Railway deployment with:
- âœ… Environment variable support for API URL
- âœ… Railway configuration file (`railway.json`)
- âœ… Production build optimization
- âœ… Static file serving with `serve`

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Login to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with GitHub (recommended)

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Authorize Railway to access your repositories
   - Select this repository

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - After deployment starts, go to your project
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add the following variable:
     ```
     Variable Name: REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL
     Variable Value: https://coaxial-backend-production.up.railway.app
     ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically:
     - Detect it's a React app
     - Install dependencies
     - Build the production bundle
     - Start the server
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

5. **Access Your Application**
   - Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL
   - Click on "Settings" â†’ "Networking" â†’ "Generate Domain"
   - Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

#### Option B: Deploy via Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Railway Project**
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://coaxial-backend-production.up.railway.app
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

6. **Open Your App**
   ```bash
   railway open
   ```

### 3. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Networking"
4. Click "Add Custom Domain"
5. Enter your domain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
6. Update your DNS records as instructed by Railway

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variable:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` | Backend API base URL | `https://coaxial-backend-production.up.railway.app` |

### Adding Environment Variables in Railway

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Navigate to "Variables" tab
4. Click "New Variable"
5. Add `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` with your backend URL
6. Click "Add" - Railway will automatically redeploy

## Build Configuration

The app uses the following configuration (defined in `railway.json`):

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx serve -s build -l $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] Backend API is deployed and accessible
- [ ] CORS is configured on backend to allow frontend domain
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Latest code is pushed to repository
- [ ] Build runs successfully locally (`npm run build`)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue**: Build fails with "out of memory" error
- **Solution**: Railway provides sufficient memory, but if needed, contact support to increase limits

**Issue**: Dependencies installation fails
- **Solution**: Ensure `package.json` is valid and all dependencies are available

### Application Not Loading

**Issue**: White screen or errors in browser console
- **Solution**: Check if `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly
- **Solution**: Inspect browser console for errors
- **Solution**: Check Railway logs for errors

### API Connection Issues

**Issue**: API requests failing with CORS errors
- **Solution**: Configure CORS on backend to allow Railway domain
  ```java
  // Example Spring Boot CORS configuration
  @CrossOrigin(origins = {
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "https://your-frontend-app.up.railway.app"  // Your Railway frontend URL
  })
  ```
- **Note**: Make sure your backend at `coaxial-backend-production.up.railway.app` has CORS configured to allow your frontend domain

**Issue**: API requests failing with network errors
- **Solution**: Verify `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is correct
- **Solution**: Ensure backend is running and accessible
- **Solution**: Check backend logs for errors

### Deployment Not Updating

**Issue**: Changes not reflected after deployment
- **Solution**: Railway caches builds. Try:
  1. Click "Redeploy" in Railway dashboard
  2. Or push a new commit to trigger rebuild

## Monitoring

### View Logs

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click on latest deployment
5. View build and runtime logs

### Performance Monitoring

Railway provides:
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Deployments**: History of all deployments
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs

Access these in your service dashboard.

## Scaling

Railway automatically scales based on:
- Traffic patterns
- Resource usage

For custom scaling:
1. Go to service settings
2. Adjust resource limits
3. Configure auto-scaling rules

## Cost Optimization

Railway pricing:
- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month (sufficient for testing)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month + usage-based pricing

Tips to reduce costs:
1. Use environment-based deployments (staging vs production)
2. Set up auto-sleep for inactive services
3. Monitor resource usage regularly

## Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically deploys when you push to your repository:

1. **Setup Auto-Deploy**
   - Already enabled by default
   - Every push to main branch triggers deployment

2. **Branch Deployments**
   - Deploy specific branches for staging
   - Create new service for each branch

3. **Pull Request Previews**
   - Railway can create preview deployments for PRs
   - Enable in project settings

## Backend Deployment (Bonus)

If you want to deploy your Java Spring Boot backend on Railway too:

1. Create new service in Railway project
2. Connect backend repository
3. Railway will auto-detect Java/Spring Boot
4. Add environment variables (database, etc.)
5. Update frontend `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` with backend URL

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… Test all features in production
2. âœ… Configure custom domain
3. âœ… Set up monitoring and alerts
4. âœ… Configure backup strategy
5. âœ… Document production URLs for team
