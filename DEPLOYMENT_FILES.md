   - Added environment variable support for API URL
   - Changed from hardcoded `localhost:8080` to `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`

2. **src/services/userService.js**
   - Added environment variable support for API URL
   - Consistent with apiUtils.js configuration

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
- Easiest deployment method
- Automatic builds and deployments
- Free tier available
- Uses `railway.json` configuration
- Follow: `RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md`

### Option 2: Docker
- More control over deployment
- Can deploy to any container platform
- Uses `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`
- Better for complex infrastructure

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting
- Build locally with `npm run build`
- Upload `build` folder to any static host
- Configure environment variables on host
- Use `serve` package or nginx

## üìã Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Backend API is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Update `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` with backend URL
- [ ] Configure CORS on backend for frontend domain
- [ ] Test build locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Push code to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Follow deployment guide

## üîê Environment Variables

Required environment variable:
