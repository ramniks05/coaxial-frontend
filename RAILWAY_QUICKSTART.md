## Backend Deployment (Optional)

Want to deploy your Spring Boot backend on Railway too?

1. Create another service in Railway
2. Connect your backend repository
3. Railway auto-detects Java/Spring Boot
4. Add database and environment variables
5. Update `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in frontend with the new backend URL

## Common Issues

**Q: API requests not working?**  
A: Ensure `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is set to `https://coaxial-backend-production.up.railway.app` and backend has CORS configured for your frontend domain

**Q: White screen after deployment?**  
A: Check browser console and Railway logs for errors

**Q: Changes not reflecting?**  
A: Click "Redeploy" in Railway or push a new commit

## Cost

- **Free Tier**: $5 credit/month (great for testing)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month + usage ($5 credit included)

Your frontend app typically uses ~$1-2/month on the free tier.
